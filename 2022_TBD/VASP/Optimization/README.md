Here you can find the input settings of the geometric optimizations. To check our first optimization we reoptimized the final structure of the first optimization but using POTIM = 0.1 (smaller width scaling step). However, this barely affected the final structure and final energies

The PBE PAW potentials were used.

We used VASP version 5.4.4.

For all calculations a gamma centered kpoint grid was used, with:
gamma: 443
delta_Cs: 642
delta_FA: 424
