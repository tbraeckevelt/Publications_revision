Here you can the input scripts for calculations using the HSE XC functional.
INCAR_pre was used to find a good initial guess for the  wavefunction.
INCAR_HSE performs the actual HSE calculation.
Note that for D3 dispersion, the S8, A1 and A2 coefficients should be set (VASP only has the coëfficiënts for the PBE, RPBE, revPBE and PBEsol XC functionals).
Check if the right coefficients are used when using different dispersion methods 

VASP version 5.4.4 was used.
