Here you can find the input settings for the HF calculations using DFT orbitals (make sure the WAVECAR from step 1 is present in the folder)

On the VASP wiki they recommend to use HFRCUT = -1 for semiconductors and insulators. However, for the delta_Cs phase we encountered some numerical issues and therefore we avoid this setting.
