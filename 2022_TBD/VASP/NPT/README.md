Here you can find the input settings of the NPT MD simulation.

Note that we only used this MD simulation to generate initial structure, we did not optimize the settings to achieve accurate energies/forces or good sampling in the NPT ensemble.

The PBE PAW potentials were used.

We used VASP version 5.4.4.

For all calculations a gamma centered kpoint grid was used, with: \
gamma: 332  \
delta_Cs: 532 \
delta_FA: 323
