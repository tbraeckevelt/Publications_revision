For all calculations the PBE PAW potentials were used

For all calculations a gamma centered kpoint grid was used \
For all XC functionals and dispersion methods, except for PBE+MBD(/FI) the following grids were used: \
gamma: 443 \
delta_Cs: 642 \
delta_FA: 424 \
For PBE+MBD(/FI) the following grids were used: \
gamma: 665  \
delta_Cs: 864 \
delta_FA: 747 

The input settings and the used VASP versions for each XC functional and despersion method can be found in the seperate subfolders
