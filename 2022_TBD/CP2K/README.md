In the subfolder InitialxyzStructures you can find the initial unit cells from which we started the NPT simulations at different tempertures to generate the input for the SchNet MLP and to calculate the average volume at different temperatures for the NVT and NVE simulations

You can find an example of the input files for the NPT, NVT and NVE simulations in the corresponding subfolders
The database files needed for those calculations can be found here
